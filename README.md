## Introduction
This project is about creating a Todo List in CLI that will be based on rust language.

it will function as followed : 
when the user will launch the program, there will be a menu asking him if he wants to :
1) create a new list
2) update an existing list
3) delete an existing list
4) leave the program

the todo lists will be stored in json files with the name of the todolist given by the user.
for instance, if the user says : create the list todolist1, it'll create a todolist1.json file that will store the elements.

the elements will have 2 attributes : 
1) Name : name of the element in the todo list
2) State : To start, ongoing, or done.
